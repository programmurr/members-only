# Members Only

An assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs/lessons/members-only)

*In this project you’ll be building an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write anonymous posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is, but outside they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it. This will be a chance for you to use the authentication skills we learned in the last project, you also be practicing your database skills.*

*When users sign up, they should not be automatically given membership status! What fun is a private club if just anyone can join? Add a page where members can “join the club” by entering a secret passcode. If they enter the passcode correctly then update their membership status.*
